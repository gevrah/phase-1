Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
Creating a repository on GitHub is easy! Once logged in to GitHub, click the small plus sign in the top right corner, and click "New repository." This will give you options for naming and licensing, which are circumstantial and there's no need to worry about them. After you've clicked Create Repository, you'll be on a page and the repo's URL will be displayed. In your workspace, enter "git clone [URL]" and you'll have a clone of your repo on your local computer! 
Describe what open source means.
Open source is when the developer makes the code of any software available to the public to look at and change in any way they'd like.
What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I love the idea of Open Source. Community minded folks can do some amazing things, and when everyone has access to the info they need, it empowers and inspires people on a user level to create, change, and fix whatever they'd like.
Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licenses allow a great deal of autonomy to a creator. They get to decide how much control the public has over their product, whether it's complete control or very restricted or somewhere in between.
What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
Working around with Git in general helped out a lot, in terms of becoming comfortable with the processes. I had to go through the process twice, just to make sure I understood what I was doing, but by the end, I felt a lot more comfortable. I also did a little fist pump when I typed in the URL and saw the tiny bit of HTML at work.
Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I stuck mostly to the provided material, but the articles on licenses were very interesting primers that gave me a better idea of how developers are putting their work out into the world.
