1.1 Think about Time Reflection
Reading through some of these articles was very helpful in framing a mindset that will help me become a more effective and happy worker. The article I focused on was about mindfulness and it's positive effect on nearly all aspects of productivity. The idea is to take a moment to consciously evaluate your instincts and gut reactions, making sure that what you're feeling is an actively productive feeling and not a knee-jerk reaction against creativity or rocking the boat. 

The Time Boxing concept fits well into this idea of mindful work. Time Boxing carves out a specified length of time to work on a project with a definitive end. This works to allow for critical stopping points where a team can evaluate the work that's been done. I currently work until I run out of energy, which sometimes can work well, but lots of times I end up losing focus and perspective and the latter portion of my work suffers for it. 

Both Time Boxing and mindfulness are absolutely employable tactics for effective work that I will make use of as often as I can. Overall, I'd like to set very specific dates and times for getting work done, and consistently evaluating what I accomplished and what else needs to be done. I hope that by being mindful of my work and of myself, my output will be strong and my education will benefit as a whole.

1.2 The Command Line Reflection
A shell is a rudimentary computer that takes command line inputs and interprets them. Bash is the Unix language that's used to manipulate and work within the confines of Unix through command lines. The most challenging aspect of this exercise was trying to remember some of the more complicated usages, like cp, and to try and utilize them within the exercise. It wasn't awful, just took a little bit of reviewing. In the end, I was able to successfully use every command and work through the commands right along with the instructions. The most important (and maybe the most fun) command seemed to be mkdir, which is a pretty amazing and powerful tool to watch in action. 

Here are the commands we went over, and their functions:

pwd-print working directory: This shows what folder (directory) you're working in.

ls-list directory: Lists the contents of the current directory.

mv-move file: Renames files

cd-change directory: Allows you to move around within directories.

../ - moves up the directory path

touch

mkdir-make directory: This literally creates folders on the fly.

less-view files: Allows you to view the contents of a file.

rmdir-remove directory: Literally deletes folders.

rm-remove file: Does what it says, removes files.

help-provides information about specific or possible commands

 
1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection
My instructions for a person new to repos would be:

-To create a repo, log on to GitHub, find the add button (the little plus sign in the top right) and follow the instructions.

-To fork a repo, find the specific repo on GitHub, make sure you're logged in, and click the fork button. That should split the original and give you a forked version on your account. This allows you to take work that someone has done up to a certain point and continue that work without making changes to the original file. They can be combined later. 

-To clone a repo, find the URL for the specific repo on GitHub, open your terminal and type "git clone [REPO URL]". This will add the cloned repo to your workspace!

I hit a few speedbumps along the way, but during this process, I learned my way around my own workspace a lot, and also began to get a more holistic grasp of Git and GitHub in general.
