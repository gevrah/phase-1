#How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
You can use Chrome's DevTools inspector so you can see the edits and changes in real time. You can use the formatting and see how different css tags do different things to your page. 
​
#How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
You can use height and width tags, as well as the position tag to resize elements in CSS.
​
​
#What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
Absolute- This position is relative to the html container it is in.
Fixed- Positioned so it stays relative to the screen and does not move if the page is scrolled. 
Relative- Positioned relative the default position. When you set the properties, it adjusts it relative to where it would have been by default. 
Static- This is the default, not affected by top/bottom/left/right properties
​
It was difficult to understand the difference between each one, we only used Absolute and Fixed. Some of the positions that we played around with did not look different visually, so we weren't sure which was exactly correct to use. 
​
#What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?
Margin is the space from the edge of the page, padding is the space outside of the object, the border is the space outside of the padding.
​
#What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
This challenge was pretty difficult, as we could not get a good grasp on all the concepts and put them into action effectively, which led to a few stumbling blocks along the way. Things that we thought were straight forward and easy ended up being more frustrating.
