What is a wireframe?<br>
A wireframe is a rough outline or blueprint of your future site. It lays out the structure on a very basic level without any design elements at all.  <br>
What are the benefits of wireframing? <br>
Wireframing allows you to see your site on a bare bones level, and to determine its functionality and how the user interacts with it. It also allows you to visualize the site, and to see if certain concepts will work or not on a strictly logistical level. <br>
Did you enjoy wireframing your site? <br>
To be honest, I didn't love it. But I've always been more of a run and gun kind of project worker, eschewing rough drafts in favor of multiple attempts and revisions. Maybe creating wireframes will help organize my thoughts and end up saving time and energy. <br>
Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?<br>
So far, I've stuck with the first idea, but I did have to shift things around just to get them to fit. I'm sure I'll do a lot more shifting and maneuvering in the future! <br>
What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them? <br>
The first thing I asked myself was how did the first article we read get such clean looking wireframes. I couldn't find a specific tool to build something so nice looking, but I did use their wireframe as a model to build my own. Relevant links included:<br>

Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious? <br>
I enjoyed having a finished product. Like I said before, the rough outline isn't my thing, so the beginning of the wireframe was a little frustrating. Once I got a full (still very rough, I know) build, I felt a lot better about the whole thing.
