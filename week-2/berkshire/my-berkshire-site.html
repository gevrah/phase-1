<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?<br>
Translating previous learning into an HTML site was surprisingly straightforward. It was also very satisfying. Seeing simple lines of text and recognizing how they'd be implimented (be it lists, tables, links, etc) was super satisfying and a really helpful exercise.<br>
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements? <br>
It was good. There are tons of resources out there for tiny helpful things like the copyright symbol, but also for larger concepts like embedding images and keeping lists organized and links clean. <br>
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML) 
This went surprisingly well. Maybe it's because the original Berkshire site is super rudimentary, but using the simple HTML elements seemed to build a nearly identical site without much formatting or need for any CSS design work. <br>
- What seems good and bad about HTML? <br>
HTML seems to be a wonderful tool for building the basics of a site. Sort of like a skeleton that will function without any flash. On the other hand, it comes out looking ugly and plain. Things are out of line and colorless. But there are other more useful tools for that!<br>
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML? <br>
I don't have too many tricks, but one thing that I am trying to keep in mind is that the answer to any problem is always much easier than any complicated spiral you wind up falling through. For example, bullet points coud lead to a complex path of research and elemental addition, when in reality, all you need to do is put your items in a list, and the bullet points show up! There's almost always a clean and easy answer, sometimes you just need to take a step back.
