What are the 6 Phases of Web Design? <br>
The Six Phases of Web Design are important factors that must be considered when building and designing any site. They help inform the decisions a designer makes and the outlook they have toward their design process. They are:<br>
1. Information Gathering <br>
2. Planning <br>
3. Design <br>
4. Development <br>
5. Testing and Delivery <br>
6. Maintenance <br> <br>

What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?<br>
The preliminary goal of my site is to provide a positive profile of myself, showcasing pertinent professional information, contact information, a short bio, and some insight into the projects I have worked on. <br> 
What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?<br>
My target audience will be looking for potential employees, in particular, a showcase of their skills and design abilities. Hopefully the functionality of my site will show off some of those abilities, by functioning effectively and efficiently while breaking down my skills as a developer. <br>
What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors. <br>
I think the primary action I want the user to take is to look at my portfolio of work. This will be a great look at what kind of work I do as a developer and maybe a look at myself as a person too!<br>
What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?<br>
Some of the key aspects of design are much deeper than surface level aesthetics. A wesbiste's design needs to be thoughtfully focused with purpose in mind, which includes the target audience, specific content, and end goals for the site. <br> 
What is user experience design and why is it valuable?  <br>
Not only should a site make the target audience happy on a surface level, but it should be easy to use, valuable, utilitarian, and efficient for the user. These are all important factors of a user experience focused system. <br>
Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious? <br>
I had a hard time trying to display the image of the site map. It was fairly tedious trying to figure out the correct markdown language and relative path while commiting, pushing, and pulling the repo in order to see if it had worked. Hopefully it's working right now!
