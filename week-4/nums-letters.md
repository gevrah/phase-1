<strong>What is an integer? What is a float?</strong><br>
<strong>An integer is a round number, without any decimal point. A float is a number with a decimal point (short for floating-point number).<br><br>
What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?</strong><br>
Float division gives an exact number while integer division gives the closest full number, rounding down any decimal or remainder. You can explain it by suggesting that we have 5 dollars to buy books and each book is two dollars. 5/2 is 2.5, but since books can only be bought as a whole, we could only buy 2 books (the 2.5 is rounded down to the nearest integer).
