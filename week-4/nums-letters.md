<strong>What does puts do?</strong><br>
Puts displays the output of a code and displays it on a new line.<br><br>
<strong>What is an integer? What is a float?</strong><br>
An integer is a round number, without any decimal point. A float is a number with a decimal point (short for floating-point number).<br><br>
<strong>What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?</strong><br>
Float division gives an exact number while integer division gives the closest full number, rounding down any decimal or remainder. You can explain it by suggesting that we have 5 dollars to buy books and each book is two dollars. 5/2 is 2.5, but since books can only be bought as a whole, we could only buy 2 books (the 2.5 is rounded down to the nearest integer). 

```
puts 24*356

puts (60*24)*(365*10)
```

<strong>How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?</strong><br>
Ruby follows basic calculator rules, w/r/t simple arithmetic. It can add, subtract, multiply, and divide both integers and floats (as well as exponentially multiply and calculate a modulus)<br><br>
<strong>What is the difference between integers and floats?</strong><br>
An integer is a round number, without any decimal point. A float is a number with a decimal point (short for floating-point number). One can be a partial number and the other cannot <br><br>

<strong>What are strings? Why and when would you use them?</strong><br>
Strings are collections of letters (or numbers) that function as singular entities, with the ability to be plugged arithmetically into formulas or variables<br><br>
<strong>What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?</strong><br>
Local variables are short codes or phrases used to represent something else. You could use them to shorten a string or be a placeholder for an undefined idea (ie age, height, shoe size, etc.)<br><br>
<strong>How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?</strong><br>
This was a solid challenge, but it's given me a bit of a scare of what's to come. Some of this was a little difficult to dive back into. Hopefully I'll have that moment of clarity and things will smooth out from here!
